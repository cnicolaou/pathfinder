An testing exercise built around an API endpoint

## Description

You are given the [following JSON formatted](data/json_request.json) request content. The content is sent to an API endpoint written using Ruby on Rails.

You are also given the following details:

- Content type: json
- HTTP code on success: 201
- HTTP verb method: POST
- Response content: Empty

## Challenge goals

- Create a working basic Ruby on Rails application with models and controllers inspired from the struture of the objects in the JSON file.
- Chose a testing framework, include it in the application and use it to write functional tests for the API endpoint used with the content of the JSON file.
- Make sure to use git to important milestones (ie: submit regular commits of changes to git in a way to show your progress towards the end solution)

Good luck
